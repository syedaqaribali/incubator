# Incubator
**This IoT project designed a temperature-controlled incubator for premature babies. The incubator is intended to maintain a stable internal temperature within user-defined maximum and minimum temperature limits. This kind of project can be critical in providing a controlled environment for premature infants to ensure their proper development and well-being. The following features can be expected in such an incubator:**
# Main Components
**ESP32 or any other microcontroller
**DHT22 sensor (for air mode)
PT100 RTD Temperature Sensor- MAX31865 (for skin mode)
BUZZER
FAN
HEATER  
RELAY (2 SWITCH) for switching in the fan and heater****  

# Temperature Control:
**The primary function of the incubator is to regulate the internal temperature according to the specified user-defined range. The temperature should be monitored continuously and adjusted to ensure it remains within the set limits.**

# User Interface: 
**The incubator could have a user interface, possibly a digital display or a touch screen, where medical staff can input the desired temperature range for the incubator. This interface could also display the current internal temperature and other relevant information.**

# Temperature Sensing: 
**The incubator would need temperature sensors, such as the DHT22 or more accurate medical-grade sensors, to measure the internal temperature accurately. These sensors would provide data to the control system for regulation.**

# Heating and Cooling Elements: 
**The incubator should have a heating element (heater) and possibly cooling elements (fan) to adjust the internal temperature. These elements would be controlled by the system to maintain the desired temperature range.**

# Safety Measures:
**Implement safety measures to ensure that the temperature doesn't go beyond safe limits. Alarms or alerts could be triggered if the temperature deviates significantly from the set range.**

# Data Logging: 
**It might be useful to log temperature data over time. This could help medical professionals monitor the incubator's performance and ensure that temperature stability is maintained.**

# Remote Monitoring: 
**Depending on the setup, remote monitoring capabilities might be considered, allowing medical staff to check and adjust the incubator's settings even when they are not physically present.**

# Energy Efficiency: 
**Implement energy-efficient mechanisms to ensure that the incubator doesn't consume excessive power while maintaining the required temperature.**

# Ventilation and Humidity Control: 
**Depending on the specific needs, the incubator might need ventilation and humidity control using dht22 as well to create an ideal environment for premature infants.**

# Regulatory Compliance: 
**Given that this incubator is for medical use, it would need to meet specific safety and regulatory standards to ensure the health and safety of the infants.**
